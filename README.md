# Osram LIGHTIFY GardenSpot Mini rgb - AAP Version

A DTH for US version of Osram GardenSpot Mini rgb lights

 *   For use with directly connecting the US (Z HA) versions to SmartThings
 *  
 *   Without the Osram Gateway, the color loop functionality does not work for the US version of the GardenSpots (at 
 *   least until they update the firmware).  But using the "hueLoop" and "hueRandom" attributes
 *   of this DTH, one create a CoRE Piston to cause color loop (even random colors)
 *
 *   Device Tile contains sliders for individual control of hue, saturation, and transition time.
 *
 *	 Device Tile also contains buttons for (1) "hueLoop" (boolean "on" / "off" values) and  
 *   (2) "Random Hue" (causes hue to change to a random color).  Use these in CoRE to create color loop.
